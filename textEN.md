#### 3.3 Dashboard 

The dashboard proposes recommendations and alerts synchronized with the local cropping calendars at 10 critical moments of coffee production.
Identifying the potential for improvement in each cycle is crucial to obtain high quality coffee, improving plantation performance, and increasing the resilience and sustainability of practices.

Recommendations: Temperature should be regulated and air flow increased in order to improve drying without affecting flavors.
